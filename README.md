## Planning repo for participation metrics
![Participate](https://wiki.mozilla.org/images/d/d0/ParticipationSmall.png)

This repository is used for tracking [issues](https://github.com/mozilla/participation-metrics-org/issues) and feedback related to the work of the [Participation/Contribution Metrics Project](https://wiki.mozilla.org/ParticipationSystems/Participation_Metrics#Contribution_metrics:).

The aim has been to implement a tool that aggregates contribution/participation metrics from a [variety of data sources](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cO6l80lJugqaQh--FrdOt0MQ3N07mGgsK_CHRlQnB0c/edit#) across Mozilla into one place. This is the first step in getting to a set of team-level and executive dashboards on contribution/participation.

The goals are to:
a) Create a single place where this type of data can be accessed easily, rather than needing to go into multiple locations

b) Have a tool that is useful for both operational realities (e.g. finding actionable insights, setting up tests), and also for tracking overall performance at a group or executive level

c) Be able to run analysis across different data sources, removing duplicates and asking about staff/non-staff contribution. Basically getting more sophisticated about tracking contributor "journeys" and impact through Mozilla
